# Syllabus

In this course, we will start from Kotlin language fundamentals and work our way up from basic console based program to real world application with REST API.
Throughout the course, we will not only focus on how to write programmes, but also on how to test them.

In week 1, you will learn Kotlin programming language fundamentals.
In week 2, you will learn how to create working Kotlin programs and will be introduced to Spring Boot application framework.
In week 3, you will apply skills acquired in previous weeks to build an actual application.
